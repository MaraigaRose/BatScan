            <p>Help us take <em>'stock'</em> of Stockport's bats.
                <br> <br>
                Bat numbers in the North West have drastically declined over the past century. We need your help to monitor these fascinating mammals through surveys and observation in your local area. This helps us understand their population and plan survival tactics. We are part of North Lancashire Bat Group's who are partnered with the National Bat Monitoring Programme. The National Bat Monitoring Programme works with the government to conserve bat populations.</p>

                    <em>During the winter licensed bat workers monitor hibernation sites around the UK and many of them kindly share their findings with the National Bat Monitoring Programme so that we can include the data in the species population trends we produce. From winter 2021-22 we received bat counts from at least 64 volunteers at 291 sites/compartments of sites. Hibernation surveys were suspended in winter 2020-21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</em>
