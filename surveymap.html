        <h1>BatScan Survey Maps</h1>
        <p>
            In 2022, at least 619 volunteers took part and returned data for summer surveys (Roost Count, Waterway Survey and Field Survey). We are extremely grateful to each and every one of our volunteers who has helped us continue monitoring the UK's bat populations. 
        </p>
            <br>
        <p>
            During the winter licensed bat workers monitor hibernation sites around the UK and many of them kindly share their findings with the National Bat Monitoring Programme so that we can include the data in the species population trends we produce. From winter 2021-22 we received bat counts from at least 64 volunteers at 291 sites/compartments of sites. 
            Hibernation surveys were suspended in winter 2020-21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
        </p>

            Read on to see the species summary maps for each bat species. 
            <em>*Updated on 06 January 2023. The survey maps for 2022 will be updated shortly once we've received all the data.</em>
